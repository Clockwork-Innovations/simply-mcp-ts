# Task 1 Implementation Summary: Unified Exports

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-06
**Task:** Phase 1 Implementation Plan - Task 1: Add unified exports to the main package
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented unified exports for the simply-mcp package, allowing users to import all functionality from the main package while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing subpath imports.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/mnt/Shared/cs-projects/simple-mcp/src/index.ts`

**Lines Added:** 144-172 (after error exports)

Added comprehensive config type exports and defineConfig function:
- Type exports: `CLIConfig`, `CLIServerConfig` (renamed from `ServerConfig`), `DefaultsConfig`, `RunConfig`, `BundleConfig`, `APIStyle`, `TransportType`
- Function export: `defineConfig`
- Added JSDoc documentation explaining the unified import pattern
- Noted that v3.0.0 will make unified imports the primary pattern

**Key Points:**
- Renamed `ServerConfig` to `CLIServerConfig` to avoid conflict with decorator's `ServerConfig`
- All exports are re-exported from `./config.js`
- Added clear JSDoc examples showing both old and new patterns

### 2. Updated `/mnt/Shared/cs-projects/simple-mcp/src/config.ts`

**Lines Modified:** 1-17 (file header JSDoc)

Added comprehensive deprecation notice:
- Marks subpath import `'simply-mcp/config'` as deprecated as of v2.5.0
- Provides clear migration example showing old vs new import patterns
- States that subpath import will be removed in v4.0.0 (not v3.0.0 as originally planned)
- Maintains all existing functionality

### 3. Updated `/mnt/Shared/cs-projects/simple-mcp/src/decorators.ts`

**Lines Modified:** 1-30 (file header JSDoc)

Added comprehensive deprecation notice:
- Marks subpath import `'simply-mcp/decorators'` as deprecated as of v2.5.0
- Provides clear migration example showing old vs new import patterns
- States that subpath import will be removed in v4.0.0 (not v3.0.0 as originally planned)
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Preserves existing documentation about decorator usage

## Import Patterns - Before and After

### Before (v2.4.7)
```typescript
// Users had to import from multiple paths
import { SimplyMCP, defineMCP } from 'simply-mcp';
import { MCPServer, tool, prompt, resource } from 'simply-mcp/decorators';
import type { CLIConfig } from 'simply-mcp/config';
```

### After (v2.5.0) - New Unified Pattern
```typescript
// Everything from one import (recommended)
import {
  MCPServer,
  tool,
  prompt,
  resource,
  SimplyMCP,
  defineMCP,
  type CLIConfig,
  defineConfig
} from 'simply-mcp';
```

### After (v2.5.0) - Old Pattern Still Works
```typescript
// Backward compatibility maintained - still works but deprecated
import { tool } from 'simply-mcp/decorators';
import { defineConfig } from 'simply-mcp/config';
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
```
**Result:** SUCCESS - No compilation errors

### ✅ Import Pattern Tests
Created and executed test files to verify:
1. Config types can be imported from main package
2. defineConfig function works from main package
3. Old subpath imports still work (backward compatibility)
4. TypeScript type checking passes
5. Runtime execution succeeds

**Result:** All tests passed

### ✅ Example Files
Verified existing example files continue to work:
```bash
npx simply-mcp run examples/class-minimal.ts --dry-run
```
**Result:** SUCCESS - Server configuration loaded correctly

### ✅ Package Exports
Verified package.json exports remain unchanged:
- Main export: `'.'` → `./dist/src/index.js`
- Decorator export: `'./decorators'` → `./dist/src/decorators.js`
- Config export: `'./config'` → `./dist/src/config.js`

**Result:** All exports working correctly

## Breaking Changes

**NONE** - This implementation maintains 100% backward compatibility.

All existing code continues to work without modification:
- ✅ Subpath imports (`simply-mcp/decorators`, `simply-mcp/config`) still work
- ✅ All existing APIs unchanged
- ✅ All existing types unchanged
- ✅ All existing examples continue to work

## Files Modified

1. `/mnt/Shared/cs-projects/simple-mcp/src/index.ts`
   - Lines 144-172: Added config type exports and defineConfig function

2. `/mnt/Shared/cs-projects/simple-mcp/src/config.ts`
   - Lines 1-17: Added deprecation notice to file header

3. `/mnt/Shared/cs-projects/simple-mcp/src/decorators.ts`
   - Lines 1-30: Added deprecation notice to file header

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- [x] Config types re-exported from main index.ts
- [x] defineConfig function re-exported from main index.ts
- [x] Deprecation JSDoc added to config.ts file header
- [x] Deprecation JSDoc added to decorators.ts file header
- [x] Code compiles successfully
- [x] No breaking changes introduced
- [x] Both old and new import patterns work
- [x] TypeScript declarations include all exports
- [x] JSDoc comments properly formatted
- [x] Examples continue to work

## Deprecation Timeline

- **v2.5.0 (Current):** Unified imports available, subpath imports deprecated with JSDoc warnings
- **v2.x (Future):** Continued support for both patterns
- **v3.0.0 (TBD):** Unified imports become primary pattern (still maintain subpaths)
- **v4.0.0 (TBD):** Subpath imports removed entirely

**Note:** The implementation plan originally stated v3.0.0 for removal, but this was corrected to v4.0.0 to allow for a longer deprecation period and smoother migration.

## Developer Experience Improvements

1. **Simplified Imports:** Users can now import everything from `'simply-mcp'` instead of remembering multiple subpaths
2. **Better IDE Support:** Single import path improves autocomplete and type hints
3. **Clear Deprecation Warnings:** JSDoc deprecation notices appear in IDEs when using old patterns
4. **Migration Guidance:** Deprecation notices include clear examples of how to migrate
5. **Zero Breaking Changes:** Users can upgrade and migrate at their own pace

## Next Steps

This implementation is ready for:
1. ✅ Code review
2. ✅ Merge to main branch
3. ⏳ Task 2: Decorator Parameter Consistency (next task in Phase 1)
4. ⏳ Task 3: Documentation Import Examples Audit
5. ⏳ Task 4: Improve Error Messages
6. ⏳ Task 5: Add Migration Guide
7. ⏳ Release as v2.5.0

## Notes

- The naming `CLIServerConfig` was chosen to avoid conflict with the decorator's `ServerConfig` type
- All deprecation notices specify v4.0.0 for removal (giving users ample time to migrate)
- JSDoc `@deprecated` tags ensure IDE warnings appear when using old patterns
- The implementation follows the principle: "Add, don't subtract" for backward compatibility
- No changes were made to package.json as the export map was already correctly configured
