## Integration with Existing Setup

### Existing Workflows

| Workflow | Integration |
|----------|-------------|
| `ci.yml` | Unchanged - continues to run on push/PR |
| `publish-npm.yml` | Unchanged - publishes on GitHub release |

### New Workflow Integration

```
Push/PR → ci.yml (automatic)
       ↓
Package changes → validate-package.yml (automatic)
       ↓
Ready for release → Decision point
       ↓
       ├─ Low risk → release.yml (manual, patch/minor/major)
       ├─ Medium risk → pre-release.yml (manual, beta)
       └─ High risk → pre-release.yml (manual, alpha/beta)
```

### Validation Scripts Integration

All workflows leverage existing validation scripts:
- `scripts/validate-package.sh` - Package structure validation
- `scripts/pre-release-test.sh` - Comprehensive pre-release testing
- `scripts/integration-test.sh` - End-to-end integration testing

## Rollout Recommendations

### Phase 1: Testing (Week 1)

1. **Validate Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Test pre-release workflow (don't publish)
   Actions → Pre-Release Validation & Publish
   version: "2.4.8-beta.1"
   publish: false  # Just validation
   tag: beta
   ```

2. **Review Generated Artifacts**
   - Check validation reports
   - Verify all checks pass
   - Review timing and duration

3. **Test Package Validation**
   ```bash
   # Make a small change and create PR
   # Verify validate-package.yml runs
   # Check validation report
   ```

### Phase 2: Beta Testing (Week 2)

1. **First Beta Release**
   ```bash
   # Choose a low-risk feature for first beta
   Actions → Pre-Release Validation & Publish
   version: "2.4.8-beta.1"
   publish: true
   tag: beta
   ```

2. **Monitor Beta**
   - Install beta: `npm install simply-mcp@beta`
   - Test functionality
   - Monitor for 2-3 days
   - Collect feedback

3. **Promote Beta to Stable**
   ```bash
   Actions → Release & Publish
   version: "promote-beta"
   ```

### Phase 3: Full Adoption (Week 3+)

1. **Use for All Releases**
   - Direct releases: Use release.yml
   - Risky changes: Use pre-release.yml

2. **Establish Patterns**
   - Document team conventions
   - Create runbooks for common scenarios
   - Train team on workflows

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Collect metrics (release frequency, issues)
