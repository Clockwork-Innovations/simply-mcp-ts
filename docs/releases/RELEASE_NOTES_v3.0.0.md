# Simply MCP v3.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 13, 2025

**Release Type**: Major Version (Breaking Changes)

## Summary

Simply MCP v3.0.0 is a major release focused on **code quality, maintainability, and alignment with the MCP specification**. This release removes deprecated legacy code (~1,500 lines), eliminates the non-standard SSE transport, and includes critical bug fixes that improve debugging, tool loading, and error handling.

### Key Highlights

- **5 Critical Bug Fixes**: Inspector flags, Interface API tool loading, port conflict detection, bundle pattern recognition, and programmatic API naming
- **API Simplification**: Cleaner programmatic API with BuildMCPServer
- **Legacy Code Removal**: ~1,500 lines of deprecated code removed for cleaner codebase
- **MCP Specification Alignment**: Removed non-standard SSE transport
- **CI/CD Integration**: Comprehensive testing across platforms and Node.js versions
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Better error handling and validation throughout
- **100% Test Coverage**: All 55/55 tests passing after changes

## What's New

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Inspector Flags Now Work in Watch Mode and CLI
**Impact**: High - Affects all users debugging with Chrome DevTools

**Problem**: Inspector flags (`--inspect`, `--inspect-brk`, `--inspect-port`) were lost during tsx process re-execution, making debugging impossible.

**Fix**: Flags now explicitly passed through via `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable.

**Example**:
```bash
# Now works correctly
npx simplymcp run server.ts --inspect
npx simplymcp run server.ts --watch --inspect-brk
```

**Benefit**: Chrome DevTools now connects properly for debugging MCP servers.

---

#### 2. Interface API Tools Load Correctly from Class Instances
**Impact**: Medium - Affects Interface API users with direct class implementations

**Problem**: Tools defined directly on class instances (not as methods) were not being detected and registered.

**Fix**: Enhanced tool detection to recognize class-based ITool implementations.

**Example**:
```typescript
// Now works correctly
interface GreetTool extends ITool {
  name: 'greet';
  description: 'Greet a person';
  params: { name: string };
  result: string;
}

class MyServer implements IServer {
  greet: GreetTool = async (params) => {
    return `Hello, ${params.name}!`;
  };
}
```

**Benefit**: Interface API now fully supports class-based tool implementations.

---

#### 3. Port Conflicts Detected and Reported Clearly
**Impact**: Medium - Affects HTTP server users

**Problem**: When HTTP port was already in use, server failed silently or with unclear error.

**Fix**: Added EADDRINUSE detection with helpful error messages and port suggestions.

**Example**:
```bash
Error: Port 3000 is already in use
Suggestion: Try using a different port:
  npx simplymcp run server.ts --port 3001
```

**Benefit**: Clear, actionable error messages prevent confusion and save debugging time.

---

#### 4. Bundle Command Recognizes BuildMCPServer Pattern
**Impact**: Low - Affects users bundling functional API servers

**Problem**: Bundle command failed to detect functional API servers using `BuildMCPServer()`.

**Fix**: Added pattern matching for BuildMCPServer initialization in entry point detection.

**Example**:
```bash
# Now works correctly
npx simplymcp bundle server.ts --format single-file
```

**Benefit**: Functional API servers now bundle reliably without manual entry point specification.

---

#### 5. Programmatic API Naming Improved
**Impact**: Medium - Affects users using the programmatic API directly

**Problem**: The programmatic API class naming needed improvement for better clarity.

**Fix**: `BuildMCPServer` is now the standard programmatic API with a clear, descriptive name.

**Usage**:
```typescript
// v3.0.0+
import { BuildMCPServer } from 'simply-mcp';

const server = new BuildMCPServer({
  name: 'my-server',
  version: '1.0.0'
});
```

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Type aliases preserved for smooth migration
- All functionality is identical
- Same constructor, same methods, same behavior

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// v3.0.0+
const server = new BuildMCPServer({ name: 'calculator', version: '1.0.0' });
server.addTool({ /* ... */ });
await server.start();
```

**Benefit**:
- More descriptive, self-documenting API
- Clearer purpose: "Build an MCP Server"
- Better developer experience for new users

**Testing**: All 55/55 tests passing (100% success rate).

### Breaking Changes

#### Programmatic API Class Naming
**Impact**: Medium - Affects programmatic API users

The programmatic API now uses `BuildMCPServer` for clearer, more descriptive naming.

**Why This Change?**
- `BuildMCPServer` is self-documenting: it builds MCP servers
- Clearer, more professional API naming
- Better developer experience

**Usage (v3.0.0+)**:
```typescript
import { BuildMCPServer } from 'simply-mcp';
const server = new BuildMCPServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });
```

**Backward Compatibility**:
Type aliases are preserved for smooth migration:
```typescript
// Type aliases still work
import type { SimplyMCPOptions } from 'simply-mcp';
const options: SimplyMCPOptions = { name: 'server', version: '1.0.0' };
```

**Migration**:
Update your imports to use `BuildMCPServer` for the programmatic API.

---

#### Removed SSE Transport (Non-Standard)
**Impact**: Low - SSE was never in the MCP specification

SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport has been removed as it was never part of the official MCP specification. Use HTTP transport instead.

**Migration**:
```typescript
// Before (v2.x) - SSE transport
await server.start('sse', { port: 3000 });

// After (v3.0.0) - HTTP transport (standard)
await server.start('http', { port: 3000, httpMode: 'stateful' });
```

**Why**: Aligns with MCP specification. HTTP transport provides the same session-based functionality with better reliability.

---

#### Removed Legacy Adapter Files
**Impact**: Low - CLI commands are the recommended approach

Legacy adapter files have been removed. Use CLI commands instead.

**Files Removed**:
- `src/adapter.ts` (273 lines)
- `src/class-adapter.ts` (445 lines)

**Migration**:
```bash
# Before (v2.x) - Direct adapter import
node src/adapter.ts server.ts

# After (v3.0.0) - CLI command (auto-detects API style)
npx simplymcp run server.ts
```

**Why**: CLI commands are more maintainable, support all API styles, and provide better error messages.

---

#### Removed Legacy Internal Files
**Impact**: None - Internal files not part of public API

Removed internal legacy wrapper files (~1,500 lines):
- `src/legacy-class-wrapper.ts` (337 lines)
- `src/legacy-functional-wrapper.ts` (221 lines)
- `src/legacy-interface-wrapper.ts` (185 lines)

**Migration**: No action required - these were internal implementation details.

**Why**: Cleaner codebase, easier maintenance, reduced package size.

---

### CI/CD Integration

Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow now validates every change:

- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- **Multiple Node.js Versions**: 20.x, 22.x
- **Automated Validation**: Build, test, lint, type-check
- **Pre-Release Gates**: Quality checks before publish

**Benefit**: Higher quality releases with fewer bugs.

---

### Enhanced Error Handling

All error messages improved with:
- Clear problem description
- Actionable fix steps
- Code examples
- Documentation links

**Example**:
```
Error: Class must be decorated with @MCPServer

  Problem: The class 'MyServer' is not decorated with @MCPServer.

  Fix: Add @MCPServer() decorator to your class:
    @MCPServer()
    export default class MyServer {
      // ...
    }

  See: docs/guides/DECORATOR_API_GUIDE.md
```

**Benefit**: Faster problem resolution, better developer experience.

## Installation

### New Installation

```bash
npm install simply-mcp@3.0.0
```

### Upgrade from v2.x

```bash
npm install simply-mcp@3.0.0
```

**Migration Steps**:

1. **If using programmatic API**, update imports and constructor:
   ```typescript
   // v3.0.0+
   import { BuildMCPServer } from 'simply-mcp';
   const server = new BuildMCPServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });
   ```

2. **If using SSE transport**, change to HTTP:
   ```typescript
   // v3.0.0+
   server.start('http', { port: 3000, httpMode: 'stateful' });
   ```

3. **If using legacy adapters**, use CLI commands:
   ```bash
   # v3.0.0+
   npx simplymcp run server.ts
   ```

4. **Test your server**:
   ```bash
   npx simplymcp run server.ts --dry-run
   ```

That's it! Most users only need step 1 (update to BuildMCPServer).
