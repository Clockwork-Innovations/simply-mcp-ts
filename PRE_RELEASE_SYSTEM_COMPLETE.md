## Testing Strategies

### Strategy 1: Local Tarball Testing (⚡ Fastest)
**Best for:** Low-risk changes, quick iterations

**Process:**
1. Build and create tarball
2. Test in /tmp directory
3. Validate all features
4. Decision: release or iterate

**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Risk:** Low (no public exposure)

---

### Strategy 2: NPM Beta Tag (🎯 Recommended)
**Best for:** Medium to high-risk changes

**Process:**
1. Publish to `@beta` tag
2. Team and community testing
3. Iterate if issues found
4. Promote to `latest` when validated

**Time:** Hours to days
**Risk:** Medium (public but marked beta)

---

### Strategy 3: GitHub Registry (🔒 Private)
**Best for:** Enterprise, private testing

**Process:**
1. Publish to GitHub Packages
2. Private team testing
3. Transition to npm when ready

**Time:** Hours to days
**Risk:** Low (private registry)

## Recommendations

### For v2.5.0 Release

**Recommended Strategy:** NPM Beta Release

**Rationale:**
- Medium-risk changes (UX improvements, new unified exports)
- API additions (backward compatible)
- No breaking changes
- Benefits from community testing
- Can iterate if issues found

**Timeline:**
1. **Day 1:** Publish beta, run validation scripts
2. **Day 2-3:** Beta testing period, community feedback
3. **Day 4:** Fix any issues, publish beta.2 if needed
4. **Day 5:** Promote to stable if no issues

### Validation Order

**Recommended sequence:**
1. ✅ `quick-validate.sh` - During development
2. ✅ `validate-package.sh` - Before creating tarball
3. ✅ `pre-release-test.sh` - Before publishing beta
4. ✅ `integration-test.sh` - Before promoting to stable

### Beta Release Checklist

- [ ] Update version to beta: `npm version 2.5.0-beta.1 --no-git-tag-version`
- [ ] Run all validation scripts
- [ ] Publish to beta tag: `npm publish --tag beta`
- [ ] Test beta installation: `npm install simply-mcp@beta`
- [ ] Run all examples with beta version
- [ ] Wait 24-48 hours for feedback
- [ ] Fix issues and iterate if needed
- [ ] Promote to stable: `npm version 2.5.0 && npm publish`
- [ ] Create git tag: `git tag v2.5.0`
- [ ] Push to GitHub: `git push origin main --tags`
- [ ] Create GitHub release

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Status
- ✅ All scripts created and functional
- ✅ All documentation complete
- ⚠️ Scripts may take time for full npm install tests
- ⚠️ Integration tests require clean /tmp directory

### Recommendations
- Scripts work best on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)
- Ensure adequate disk space in /tmp (at least 500MB)
- Node.js >=20.0.0 required
- npm >=9.0.0 recommended
